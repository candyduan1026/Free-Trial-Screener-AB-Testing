    "## Experiment Overview:\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",
    "Any place \"unique cookies\" are mentioned, the uniqueness is determined by day. (That is, the same cookie visiting on different days would be counted twice.) User-ids are automatically unique since the site does not allow the same user-id to enroll twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric Choice\n",
    "* Number of cookies: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=3000)\n",
    "* Number of user-ids: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. (dmin=50)\n",
    "* Number of clicks: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (dmin=240)\n",
    "* Click-through-probability: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=0.01)\n",
    "* Gross conversion: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.01)\n",
    "* Retention: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)\n",
    "* Net conversion: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.0075)\n",

    "The number of user-ids would be lower in the experiment group, but what does it measure? The user-id can be divided into two groups: students with less than 5 hours and students with more than 5 hours. When the first group see the screener, they may be discouraged and therefore will not choose to enroll the course. This group can be labeld as \"frustrated students\". The second group is really determinant and have more time on the course, so they can be \"resolute students\". The screener wants to reduce the number of \"frustrated students\" who might quit before the course ends but doesn't want to reduce the number of \"resolute students\". The gross conversion measures the frustrated portion and the net conversion measures the resolute students. As we expected, the gross conversion in the experiment group shows statistically signicant difference than the gross conversion in the controlled group. Also, the net conversion doesn't have statistically difference. Therefore, we would recommend lunch the product. "
